# PureLB will act as the default service announcer if this value is
# "PureLB". This means that PureLB will handle services that do not
# have a Spec.LoadBalancerClass field. If this is other than "PureLB"
# then PureLB will handle only those services that have a
# Spec.LoadBalancerClass explictly set to "purelb.io/purelb".

# This value is passed into the memberlist package. Quoting from the
# memberlist docs:
#
#   SecretKey is used to initialize the primary encryption key in a
#   keyring.  The primary encryption key is the only key used to
#   encrypt messages and the first key used while attempting to
#   decrypt messages. Providing a value for this primary key will
#   enable message-level encryption and verification, and
#   automatically install the key onto the keyring.  The value should
#   be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes to select AES-128, AES-192, or
#   AES-256.
#
# See PureLB's internal/election package docs for more info on how
# PureLB uses memberlist.
#
# This random default value is fine for most purposes but for extra
# security you can replace it with your own value.
